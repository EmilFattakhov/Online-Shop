class Question < ApplicationRecord
    # This is the Question model. We generate this 
    # file with the command:
    # rails g model question title:string body:text
    # This command also genrates a migration file 
    # in db/migrate

    # Adding 'dependent: :destroy' option tells rails to
    # delete associated records before deleting the record
    # itself. In this case, when a question is deleted,
    # its answers are deleted first to satisfy the foreign
    # key constraint.
    # You can also use 'dependent: :nullify' which will
    # cause all associated answers to have their question_id
    # column set to NULL before the question is destroyed.

    # if you don't use either dependent options, you will end 
    # up with answers in your db referencing question_ids
    # that no longer exist, likely leading to errors.
    # Always set a dependent option to help maintain 
    # referential integrity.
    has_many(:answers, dependent: :destroy)
    # has_many(:answers, dependent: :destroy) adds
    # the following instance methods to the Question model:
    # .answers
    # .answers<<(object, ...)
    # .answers.delete(object, ...)
    # .answers.destroy(object, ...)
    # .answers=(object)
    # .answers_singular_ids
    # .answers.singular_ids=(ids)
    # .answers.clear
    # .answers.empty?
    # .answers.size
    # .answers.find(...)
    # .answers.where(...)
    # .answers.exists?(...)
    # .answers.built(attribute = {}, ...)
    # .answers.create(attributes = {}, ...)
    # .answers.create!(attributes = {}, ...)

    # source singularized(i.e. tag), then 'source' named argument 
    # can be omitted

    def tag_names 
        self.tags.map(&:name).join(", ")
        # The & symbol is used to tell Ruby that the following argument
        # should be treated as a block given to the method. So the line:
        # self.tags.map(&:name).join(", ")
        # is equivalent to:
        # self.tags.map { |x| x.name }.join(", ")
        # So the above will iterate over the collection self.tags
        # and build an array with the result of the name method
        # called on every item. (We then jin the array into a comma
        # separated string)
    end

    # Appending = at the end of a method name, allows us to implement
    # a 'setter'. A setter is a method that is assignable.
    # Example:
    # q.tag_names = "another tag"

    # The code in the axample above would call the method we wrote
    # below where the value on the right-hand side of the '=' would 
    # become the argument to the method

    # This is similar to implementing an 'attr_writer'

    # Create validations by using the 'validates' method
    # The arguments are (in order):

    # method that allows to repond to events during 
    # the life of a model instance (i.e. being validated, 
    #  being created, being updated etc.)

    # fetch all question
    # questions = Question.all ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back the list of questions as an object
    # the object behaves like an array so you can call methods on it like (.each) and you 
    # can also chain it with other methods to do other types of operations or querying for example:
    # Question.all.count

    # Creating a new question
    # To create a new question object in memory do:
    # q = Question.new
    # you can also pass in a hash to the new method as in:
    # q = Question.new({title: 'To be or not to be', body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 })
    # or for short:
    # q = Question.new title: 'To be or not to be', body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0

    # Saving a record in database after initializing it or creating it in memory
    # to save a record in database we call the (.save) method on the instantiated object
    # q = Question.new title: "My last question"
    # q.save

    # Creating a record in database directly
    # you can create a record right away in the DB using (.create) mthod as in:
    # Question.create({ title: "My Question Title ", body: "My question body", view_count: 0 })

    # Fetching Records 
    # .first 
    # Question.first ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the first record ordered by the id in an ascending order 
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "questions"."id" ASC LIMIT 1;

    # .last
    # Question.last ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the last record ordered by the id in an ascending order 
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "questions"."id" DESC LIMIT 1;

    # .find
    # Question.find(1) ðŸ‘ˆ finding records by their primary key which is likely id

    # .find_by_x which x is the column name
    # Question.find_by_title("One more Question") ðŸ‘ˆ this finds a question with title
    # exactly "One more Question"

    # .where
    # Question.where( {title: "My Question Title", body: "My question body" })

    # WILDCARD SEARCHING 
    # You can perform wildcard searching with ActiveRecord using LIKE within where method
    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%more%'])
    # if you are using Postgres client, you can use ILIKE for case-insensitive searching:
    # Question.where(['title ILIKE ?', '%more%'])
    # Note that in above queries we used a syntax that uses '?' to insert variable into a SQL
    # query. this is important to avoid having SQL injection if the variable component is 
    # actually a suer input such as search term.

    # .limit 
    # Question.limit(10) ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back 10 first question that are returned 
    # from the query

    # .order 
    # Question.order(:created_at) ðŸ‘ˆ this will order the fetched records by 
    # created_at by default in ASC and if you want them in descending order do:
    # Question.order(created_at: :DESC)

    # Chaining
    # you can chain the where, limit, order, offset, and many others to compose
    # more sophisticated queries for example:
    # Question.where(['view_count > ?', 10]).where(['title ILIKE ?', '%a%']).order(id: :DESC).limit(10).offset(10)
    # Note: offset will skip first 10 records 
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" WHERE (view_count > 10) AND (title ILIKE '%a%') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

    # UPDATE RECORDS
    # once you've select one or more records, you have ability to update them
    # Manually setting attributes
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.title = "UPDATED TITLE"
    # q.view_count = 10
    # q.save

    # Using .update_attribute, .update_attributes, or .update
    # q = Question.find 11
    # q.update({ title: 'UPDATED TITLE', body: 'UPDATED BODY' }) or 
    # q.update_attribute({ title: 'UPDATED TITLE' }) or 
    # q.update_attributes({ title: 'UPDATED TITLE', body: 'UPDATED BODY' }) or 

    # DELETING RECORDS
    # using .destroy 
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.destroy

    # using .delete
    # q = Question.find 11
    # q.delete

    # using .delete skips executing callback methods after_destroy and before_destroy
    # and also skips deleting or nullifying associated records in the :dependent option
    # with associations. Generally, avoid using .delete in favor of .destroy.
    # There are very few cases when you want to use .delete

    # Aggregate Functions 
    # .count
    # Question.count ðŸ‘ˆ counts the number of records in question model 
    # SQL Equivalent:
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "questions";

    # .group
    # Question.select('avg(view_count) as count').group('title')

    # CALLING RAW QUERIES
    # connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    # result = connection.execute('SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id = 20;')
    # result.first ðŸ‘ˆ because the result is an array of hashes

    # Exercise: Build a query that fetches the first 10 questions that contain
    # "el" in their titles ordered by created_at in a descending order. 
    # solution

    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%el%']).limit(10).order(created_at: :DESC)

    # Exercise: First 10 most viewed questions in last 10 days
    # Question.where('created_at >= ?', 30.days.ago).order(view_count: :DESC).limit(10)
